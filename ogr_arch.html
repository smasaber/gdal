<div class="textblock"><p>This document is intended to document the OGR classes. The OGR classes are intended to be generic (not specific to OLE DB or COM or Windows) but are used as a foundation for implementing OLE DB Provider support, as well as client side support for SFCOM. It is intended that these same OGR classes could be used by an implementation of SFCORBA for instance or used directly by C++ programs wanting to use an OpenGIS simple features inspired API.</p>
<p>Because OGR is modeled on the OpenGIS simple features data model, it is very helpful to review the SFCOM, or other simple features interface specifications which can be retrieved from the <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org">Open Geospatial Consortium</a> web site. Data types, and method names are modeled on those from the interface specifications.</p>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="ogr_arch_geometry"></a>
Geometry</h1>
<p>The geometry classes are represent various kinds of vector geometry. All the geometry classes derived from <a class="el" href="classOGRGeometry.html" title="Abstract base class for all geometry classes. ">OGRGeometry</a> which defines the common services of all geometries. Types of geometry include <a class="el" href="classOGRPoint.html" title="Point class. ">OGRPoint</a>, <a class="el" href="classOGRLineString.html" title="Concrete representation of a multi-vertex line. ">OGRLineString</a>, <a class="el" href="classOGRPolygon.html" title="Concrete class representing polygons. ">OGRPolygon</a>, <a class="el" href="classOGRGeometryCollection.html" title="A collection of 1 or more geometry objects. ">OGRGeometryCollection</a>, <a class="el" href="classOGRMultiPolygon.html" title="A collection of non-overlapping OGRPolygon. ">OGRMultiPolygon</a>, <a class="el" href="classOGRMultiPoint.html" title="A collection of OGRPoint. ">OGRMultiPoint</a>, and <a class="el" href="classOGRMultiLineString.html" title="A collection of OGRLineString. ">OGRMultiLineString</a>.</p>
<p>GDAL 2.0 extends those geometry type with non-linear geometries with the <a class="el" href="classOGRCircularString.html" title="Concrete representation of a circular string, that is to say a curve made of one or several arc circl...">OGRCircularString</a>, <a class="el" href="classOGRCompoundCurve.html" title="Utility class to store a collection of curves. ">OGRCompoundCurve</a>, <a class="el" href="classOGRCurvePolygon.html" title="Concrete class representing curve polygons. ">OGRCurvePolygon</a>, <a class="el" href="classOGRMultiCurve.html" title="A collection of OGRCurve. ">OGRMultiCurve</a> and <a class="el" href="classOGRMultiSurface.html" title="A collection of non-overlapping OGRSurface. ">OGRMultiSurface</a> classes.</p>
<p>Additional intermediate abstract base classes contain functionality that could eventually be implemented by other geometry types. These include <a class="el" href="classOGRCurve.html" title="Abstract curve base class for OGRLineString, OGRCircularString and OGRCompoundCurve. ">OGRCurve</a> (base class for <a class="el" href="classOGRLineString.html" title="Concrete representation of a multi-vertex line. ">OGRLineString</a>) and <a class="el" href="classOGRSurface.html" title="Abstract base class for 2 dimensional objects like polygons or curve polygons. ">OGRSurface</a> (base class for <a class="el" href="classOGRPolygon.html" title="Concrete class representing polygons. ">OGRPolygon</a>). Some intermediate interfaces modeled in the simple features abstract model and SFCOM are not modeled in OGR at this time. In most cases the methods are aggregated into other classes.</p>
<p>The <a class="el" href="classOGRGeometryFactory.html" title="Create geometry objects from well known text/binary. ">OGRGeometryFactory</a> is used to convert well known text, and well known binary format data into geometries. These are predefined ASCII and binary formats for representing all the types of simple features geometries.</p>
<p>In a manner based on the geometry object in SFCOM, the <a class="el" href="classOGRGeometry.html" title="Abstract base class for all geometry classes. ">OGRGeometry</a> includes a reference to an <a class="el" href="classOGRSpatialReference.html" title="This class represents an OpenGIS Spatial Reference System, and contains methods for converting betwee...">OGRSpatialReference</a> object, defining the spatial reference system of that geometry. This is normally a reference to a shared spatial reference object with reference counting for each of the <a class="el" href="classOGRGeometry.html" title="Abstract base class for all geometry classes. ">OGRGeometry</a> objects using it.</p>
<p>Many of the spatial analysis methods (such as computing overlaps and so forth) are not implemented at this time for <a class="el" href="classOGRGeometry.html" title="Abstract base class for all geometry classes. ">OGRGeometry</a>.</p>
<p>While it is theoretically possible to derive other or more specific geometry classes from the existing <a class="el" href="classOGRGeometry.html" title="Abstract base class for all geometry classes. ">OGRGeometry</a> classes, this isn't an aspect that has been well thought out. In particular, it would be possible to create specialized classes using the <a class="el" href="classOGRGeometryFactory.html" title="Create geometry objects from well known text/binary. ">OGRGeometryFactory</a> without modifying it.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="ogr_arch_geometry_compat_curves"></a>
Compatibility issues with GDAL 2.0 non-linear geometries</h2>
<p>Generic mechanisms have been introduced so that creating or modifying a feature with a non-linear geometry in a layer of a driver that does not support it will transform that geometry in the closest matching linear geometry.</p>
<p>On the other side, when retrieving data from the OGR C API, the <a class="el" href="ogr__api_8h.html#a31febe0b845d7cc0052767e6257e7349" title="Set flag to enable/disable returning non-linear geometries in the C API. ">OGRSetNonLinearGeometriesEnabledFlag()</a> function can be used, so that geometries and layer geometry type returned are also converted to their linear approximation if necessary.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="ogr_arch_srs"></a>
Spatial Reference</h1>
<p>The <a class="el" href="classOGRSpatialReference.html" title="This class represents an OpenGIS Spatial Reference System, and contains methods for converting betwee...">OGRSpatialReference</a> class is intended to store an OpenGIS Spatial Reference System definition. Currently local, geographic and projected coordinate systems are supported. Vertical coordinate systems, geocentric coordinate systems, and compound (horizontal + vertical) coordinate systems are as well supported in recent GDAL versions.</p>
<p>The spatial coordinate system data model is inherited from the OpenGIS <b>Well Known Text</b> format. A simple form of this is defined in the Simple Features specifications. A more sophisticated form is found in the Coordinate Transformation specification. The <a class="el" href="classOGRSpatialReference.html" title="This class represents an OpenGIS Spatial Reference System, and contains methods for converting betwee...">OGRSpatialReference</a> is built on the features of the Coordinate Transformation specification but is intended to be compatible with the earlier simple features form.</p>
<p>There is also an associated <a class="el" href="classOGRCoordinateTransformation.html" title="Interface for transforming between coordinate systems. ">OGRCoordinateTransformation</a> class that encapsulates use of PROJ.4 for converting between different coordinate systems. There is a <a href="osr_tutorial.html">tutorial</a> available describing how to use the <a class="el" href="classOGRSpatialReference.html" title="This class represents an OpenGIS Spatial Reference System, and contains methods for converting betwee...">OGRSpatialReference</a> class.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="ogr_arch_feature"></a>
Feature / Feature Definition</h1>
<p>The <a class="el" href="classOGRGeometry.html" title="Abstract base class for all geometry classes. ">OGRGeometry</a> captures the geometry of a vector feature ... the spatial position/region of a feature. The <a class="el" href="classOGRFeature.html" title="A simple feature, including geometry and attributes. ">OGRFeature</a> contains this geometry, and adds feature attributes, feature id, and a feature class identifier. Starting with OGR 1.11, <a href="http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/rfc41_multiple_geometry_fields">several geometries</a> can be associated to a <a class="el" href="classOGRFeature.html" title="A simple feature, including geometry and attributes. ">OGRFeature</a>.</p>
<p>The set of attributes, their types, names and so forth is represented via the <a class="el" href="classOGRFeatureDefn.html" title="Definition of a feature class or feature layer. ">OGRFeatureDefn</a> class. One <a class="el" href="classOGRFeatureDefn.html" title="Definition of a feature class or feature layer. ">OGRFeatureDefn</a> normally exists for a layer of features. The same definition is shared in a reference counted manner by the feature of that type (or feature class).</p>
<p>The feature id (FID) of a feature is intended to be a unique identifier for the feature within the layer it is a member of. Freestanding features, or features not yet written to a layer may have a null (OGRNullFID) feature id. The feature ids are modeled in OGR as a 64-bit integer (GDAL 2.0 or later); however, this is not sufficiently expressive to model the natural feature ids in some formats. For instance, the GML feature id is a string.</p>
<p>The feature class also contains an indicator of the types of geometry allowed for that feature class (returned as an OGRwkbGeometryType from <a class="el" href="classOGRFeatureDefn.html#acb2f448cdb78e5e4ae83f0a29f33fa3b" title="Fetch the geometry base type. ">OGRFeatureDefn::GetGeomType()</a>). If this is wkbUnknown then any type of geometry is allowed. This implies that features in a given layer can potentially be of different geometry types though they will always share a common attribute schema. </p>
<p>Starting with OGR 1.11, several geometry fields can be associated to a feature class. Each geometry field has its own indicator of geometry type allowed, returned by <a class="el" href="classOGRGeomFieldDefn.html#a088ac91c3b67ede2d38fffecdffd3e8e" title="Fetch geometry type of this field. ">OGRGeomFieldDefn::GetType()</a>, and its spatial reference system, returned by <a class="el" href="classOGRGeomFieldDefn.html#a4f7e11687e08207cd0b1f8747e518c4c" title="Fetch spatial reference system of this field. ">OGRGeomFieldDefn::GetSpatialRef()</a>.</p>
<p>The <a class="el" href="classOGRFeatureDefn.html" title="Definition of a feature class or feature layer. ">OGRFeatureDefn</a> also contains a feature class name (normally used as a layer name).</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="ogr_arch_layer"></a>
Layer</h1>
<p>An <a class="el" href="classOGRLayer.html" title="This class represents a layer of simple features, with access methods. ">OGRLayer</a> represents a layer of features within a data source. All features in an <a class="el" href="classOGRLayer.html" title="This class represents a layer of simple features, with access methods. ">OGRLayer</a> share a common schema and are of the same <a class="el" href="classOGRFeatureDefn.html" title="Definition of a feature class or feature layer. ">OGRFeatureDefn</a>. An <a class="el" href="classOGRLayer.html" title="This class represents a layer of simple features, with access methods. ">OGRLayer</a> class also contains methods for reading features from the data source. The <a class="el" href="classOGRLayer.html" title="This class represents a layer of simple features, with access methods. ">OGRLayer</a> can be thought of as a gateway for reading and writing features from an underlying data source, normally a file format. In SFCOM and other table based simple features implementation an <a class="el" href="classOGRLayer.html" title="This class represents a layer of simple features, with access methods. ">OGRLayer</a> represents a spatial table.</p>
<p>The <a class="el" href="classOGRLayer.html" title="This class represents a layer of simple features, with access methods. ">OGRLayer</a> includes methods for sequential and random reading and writing. Read access (via the <a class="el" href="classOGRLayer.html#a466c14ed1b3cca83abda52729d590dd2" title="Fetch the next available feature from this layer. ">OGRLayer::GetNextFeature()</a> method) normally reads all features, one at a time sequentially; however, it can be limited to return features intersecting a particular geographic region by installing a spatial filter on the <a class="el" href="classOGRLayer.html" title="This class represents a layer of simple features, with access methods. ">OGRLayer</a> (via the <a class="el" href="classOGRLayer.html#a0b4ab45cf97cbc470f0d60474d3e4169" title="Set a new spatial filter. ">OGRLayer::SetSpatialFilter()</a> method).</p>
<p>One flaw in the current OGR architecture is that the spatial filter is set directly on the <a class="el" href="classOGRLayer.html" title="This class represents a layer of simple features, with access methods. ">OGRLayer</a> which is intended to be the only representative of a given layer in a data source. This means it isn't possible to have multiple read operations active at one time with different spatial filters on each. This aspect may be revised in the future to introduce an OGRLayerView class or something similar.</p>
<p>Another question that might arise is why the <a class="el" href="classOGRLayer.html" title="This class represents a layer of simple features, with access methods. ">OGRLayer</a> and <a class="el" href="classOGRFeatureDefn.html" title="Definition of a feature class or feature layer. ">OGRFeatureDefn</a> classes are distinct. An <a class="el" href="classOGRLayer.html" title="This class represents a layer of simple features, with access methods. ">OGRLayer</a> always has a one-to-one relationship to an <a class="el" href="classOGRFeatureDefn.html" title="Definition of a feature class or feature layer. ">OGRFeatureDefn</a>, so why not amalgamate the classes. There are two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p class="startli">As defined now <a class="el" href="classOGRFeature.html" title="A simple feature, including geometry and attributes. ">OGRFeature</a> and <a class="el" href="classOGRFeatureDefn.html" title="Definition of a feature class or feature layer. ">OGRFeatureDefn</a> don't depend on <a class="el" href="classOGRLayer.html" title="This class represents a layer of simple features, with access methods. ">OGRLayer</a>, so they can exist independently in memory without regard to a particular layer in a data store. </p>
<p></p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="startli">The SF CORBA model does not have a concept of a layer with a single fixed schema the way that the SFCOM and SFSQL models do. The fact that features belong to a feature collection that is potentially not directly related to their current feature grouping may be important to implementing SFCORBA support using OGR.</p>
<p class="endli"></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The <a class="el" href="classOGRLayer.html" title="This class represents a layer of simple features, with access methods. ">OGRLayer</a> class is an abstract base class. An implementation is expected to be subclassed for each file format driver implemented. OGRLayers are normally owned directly by their <a class="el" href="classGDALDataset.html" title="A set of associated raster bands, usually from one file.

Dataset</h1>
<p>A <a class="el" href="classGDALDataset.html" title="A set of associated raster bands, usually from one file. ">GDALDataset</a> represents a set of <a class="el" href="classOGRLayer.html" title="This class represents a layer of simple features, with access methods. ">OGRLayer</a> objects.

<p>It is intended that a new <a class="el" href="classGDALDriver.html" title="Format specific driver.
